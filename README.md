### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcos Oliveira.

For now I'm just learning a few things around web development and finishing my college of computer science. 
I have a lot of interest in Javascript and I also work with PHP.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_olivmarcos) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_olivmarcos/).
